            <div class="box1">Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the userâ€™s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed
                through a network.</div>
            <div class="box2">Web application development will typically have a short development life-cycle lead by a small development team. Front-end development for web applications is accomplished through client-side programming. </div>
            <div class="box3">Web app development empowers web-based projects to perform and act similarly to a mobile app. Web applications engage users, prioritizing responsive interactions, but are still delivered through the internet over a network. .</div>
